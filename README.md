## PEARL Lab Website in Laravel

To install and set up Laravel, you'll need to follow these steps:

# Step 1: System Requirements
Ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- PHP >= 7.3
- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)

# Step 2: Install Composer
If you don't have Composer installed, visit the official Composer website (https://getcomposer.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

# Step 3: Install Laravel
Once you have Composer installed, you can use it to install Laravel. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

**composer global require laravel/installer

This command will install the Laravel Installer globally on your system.

# Step 4: Serve the Laravel Application
Navigate to the project directory:

**cd project-name

To start a development server and run your Laravel application, use the following command:

**php artisan serve

This command will start the development server, and you can access your Laravel application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

That's it! You've now installed and set up Laravel on your system. You can now start building your Laravel application.
